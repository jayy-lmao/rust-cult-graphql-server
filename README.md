You will need to create a `.env` file with the following.  Grab the details from James H (will send through snappass)

```sh
DATABASE_USER=
DB_PORT=
DATABASE_HOST=
DATABASE_URL=
DATABASE_PASSWORD=
```

This will need to be placed in the project root.

Then `cargo run` to run! 

Lint: `cargo fmt --all`
